# iCloud Notes

This project offers a native Windows application via Electron for accessing iCloud notes, reminders, and other content available on [icloud.com](https://www.icloud.com/). Unlike Apple's official iCloud client for Windows, which focuses on managing iCloud Drive, Photos, and Bookmarks, this client specifically targets note-taking functionality and always default to iCloud Notes.

## Setup

1. **Releases**: Download the latest release of the application.
2. **Sign in to your iCloud account**: Upon launching the application, sign in to your iCloud account to access your notes and reminders.
3. **Enjoy!**: Once signed in, you can seamlessly view and manage your iCloud notes within the Windows environment.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system to run the application.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

This command initializes the application, creates a new window, and loads the iCloud notes page.
